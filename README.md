* **Visual Portfolio:** Dedicated sections to display images and details of past events (e.g., within the `logo` folder for visual assets).
* **Service Overview:** Detailed descriptions of the event planning and execution services provided.
* **Contact Form:** A direct channel for potential clients to reach out.
